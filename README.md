# Crop Cultivation Guide

This repo contains the modules required to find the most optimum crop to be grown keeping in mind the weather, soil and crop market price conditions.

The central idea is to develop a common platform for prediction and cultivation of crop based on the prediction of the factors like weather prediction, crop prediction, yield prediction, soil estimation and other necessary factors like the previous crop.
This is beneficial for the farmers as they can select the most suitable and profitable crop rather than hearsay or previous cropping patterns. As this is a centralized system, the farmers can receive all the necessary details regarding the crop cultivation at the same place.
This system also provides scheduling for the cultivation of the selected crop throughout the season.

----------------------------

The modules included in the project are - 

1. **Weather Prediction:** Prediction of humidity, rainfall and temperature using machine learning (regression).
1. **Soil Estimation:** Keeping in mind the nutrients of the soil, suggest next crop sow.
1. **Yield Prediction:** Prediction of yield using data of previous years.
1. **Price Prediction:** Considering the price data of previous years and the yield, price and profit to be estimated.
1. **Crop Prediction:** Given the list of all the crops and their profits, the user can select their desired crop for cultivation.
